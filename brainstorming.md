Capstone App Brainstorming

## App Ideas
1. Recollection
   - There doesn't seem to exist an app that combines notes, reminders, your calendar, & spreadsheets all in one place. The idea is to essentially fill that gap and make a one stop shop for users to store their data across all four of those things. Calendar can cover any deadlines you might have. Notes can cover things like regular lists, images, map locations, so on and so forth. Reminders can be things you add to then.. be reminded about.. through notifcations. And then spreadsheets lets you do budgets & finances more officially.
2. Simple phone
    - It is an app that makes your phone more basic, less attractive and less addictive. So instead of having icons for apps we can just make buttons with the name of the app to access it, make all colors black and white. Also we can track the time spent in an app to try and limit how much time a user spends on a certain app weekly. I don't know what kind of api we could use though. 
3. Fit
    - This app will create a monthly workout for a user. We can have 4 different types of workout (legs + cardio, back, chest, and arms). We could also help the user to find the time to workout by using a calendar or planner.
4. Navigation App for Truckers
    - A navigation app that is specifically for trucks, because the one that are on the playstore like google maps and waze they just show routes for cars. However, there are routes where trucks cannot go. We could use information from internet and find an API where only truck routes are available. This would be really useful for truck drivers. Normally, they have to spend money to buy a GPS system, but with this app we can make it easy and cheap.
5. Loneliness Messaging App
    - Since there is an "epidemic of loneliness" in the US, an app that would connect users to one another could be useful. There is a quick messaging app API, and we could maybe connect people based on likes or what they want to talk about i.e. good things, bad times, family, achievements, and other selected topics.
6. Basic Business Analytics App
    - Most small businesses still staff and order product based off of memory or historical data, but this would be an app that allows users to manually decide database fields in order to store what data they wanted such as sales broken down either daily or hourly, number of employees per shift, weather which can be pulled by an API, and holidays/special events/promotions etc.  Pretty much just user defined database for small businesses
7. Calendar Navigation App
    - A linkup between map and calendar to let the user know when they need to leave and give push notifications for upcoming meetings as well as the time they need to set aside for transportation.

## Top 3 App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Recollection
   - **Mobile**: It's more than a website because it links most of its aspects to work together. On top of that, the Notes can implement many aspects including images and map markers.  
   - **Story:** There doesn't exist an app that currently combines finance management, calendar, reminders, as well as notes in one easy to access place. This app could fill that gap and be the one stop shop for everything relating to reminders and notes.
   - **Market:** Essentially any user that wants to manage their finances alongside their calendar as well as recorded notes.
   - **Habit:** At the very least, it should at least be monthly. But the frequency of use really depends on how much information the user wants to keep track of. It will include "your day at a glance," so daily use is not out of the picture.
   - **Scope:** Each version will essentially be one major feature. As the features are built, so will the links between them. i.e. the calendar should connect to the reminders. A stripped down version is still interesting to build because it should still be useful.
2. Calendar Navigation App
      - **Mobile**: This app combines your calendar events with a navigation app, and therefore serves more of a purpose than a traditional website.  
   - **Story:** For commuters in particular, there is not an app that reminds them when they should leave for certain events based on their calendar information.
   - **Market:** Primarily for people that need to travel on a frequent basis, but could really be used for anyone that wants to be reminded of travel plans based on their calendar.
   - **Habit:** It depends on how often the user travels. i.e. if it is a daily commute, you would be reminded daily. Thus, you would be interacting with the app on a daily basis. 
   - **Scope:** Each version would build each feature on top of the other. We would start with a calendar, then a way to implement your travel plans on the calendar with locations, and then finally, we would find a way to consistently send push notifications regarding the travel plans.
3. Fit
    - **Mobile**: This app would track all the workouts a potential user would want to track. It would send daily reminders to the user about the type of workout for the day, and it would integrate those workout plans onto their calendar for even more accurate tracking.  
   - **Story:** Gym users don't seem to have an app that tracks their workouts alongside their calendar, and this app would fill that niche hole for the users that want that.
   - **Market:** The market is mainly for anyone that goes to the gym, that would also like to track their workouts directly on their calendar in one unified app as opposed to multiple.
   - **Habit:** It is dependant on how often the user goes to the gym, which could be realistically anywhere from daily to weekly to monthly. Essentially, the use case of the app depends on the user. 
   - **Scope:** The initial version would start with the aspect of tracking workouts. We would then go on to implementing reminders for those workouts, and then finally we would like to implement those reminders and workouts onto a calendar.

## Final App Idea
As a group we have decided on the app idea for **Recollection.** It is a fair amount of work, but it is the app that intrigues all of us the most.
